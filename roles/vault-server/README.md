Unsealing the Vault
----------------------

Unsealing the vault requires a minimum of three Unseal Keys. The Unseal Keys can be retrieved from Vault init.file

     [root@utrutstvault01v ~]# cat /etc/vault/init.file
     Unseal Key 1: kIFvVPrcbMO5sCLC05AEqUTKqS08UoYOeNmvMv6o1pZb
     Unseal Key 2: Upb3qn7y4UJgKGHEB6gsSHphLLuwvVJxeBAUaWE3RoE8
     Unseal Key 3: uoLcgBHUG7UkKZhMqxJzBdgCplK+XVLq+e5Bn22wcQuG
     Unseal Key 4: 1U9T5mEP+LSdOwMsS+Lgl3lrbfgZqcxCN3yGGLLHhK2T
     Unseal Key 5: otaKT//+v/063GoX5KlKRLxX9aAX9sutzdqlcqmus1kR

     Initial Root Token: s.tOhI3VcuGDKzebBEL6KzSjh1

     Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
     distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
     restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
     before it can start servicing requests.

     Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 key to
     reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

     It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
     existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
     [root@utrutstvault01v ~]#


To Unseal the Vault, having gotten the Unseal Keys from the Vault init.file, use the "vault operator" command as follows:

     [root@utrutstvault01v ~]# vault operator unseal kIFvVPrcbMO5sCLC05AEqUTKqS08UoYOeNmvMv6o1pZb
     Key                Value

Vault Login
----------------------

Using the Vault CLI, login to the Vault using the "Initial Root Token"

  [root@utrutstvault01v ~]# vault login
  Token (will be hidden):
  Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
  is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
  again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

  Key                  Value
  ---                  -----
  token                s.tOhI3VcuGDKzebBEL6KzSjh1
  token_accessor       T7MP1VkkKN76HYNOX8sx7SDS
  token_duration       âˆž
  token_renewable      false
  token_policies       ["root"]
  identity_policies    []
  policies             ["root"]
  [root@utrutstvault01v ~]#

Once logged in - you're able to interact with the Vault

  [root@utrutstvault01v ~]# vault auth enable approle
  Success! Enabled approle auth method at: approle/
  [root@utrutstvault01v ~]#
